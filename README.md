<h1>Random item picker</h1>
<p>The reason I've made this is because I often find myself not being able to decide on what game to play, what manhwa to read, what clothes to wear etc. I usually go to a website called Wheel of Names, put in the things I can't decide between and then go with whatever comes out.</p>
<p>I could just try to decide on my own for once but instead, I decided to make my own simple version of this because it helps me get better at programming for school and it's the more fun option.</p>
<p>There are 2 apps in this repository:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Gui app</li>
  <li>Console app</li>
</ol>
<h2>Gui app</h2>
<p>This is the simpler version of the 2 apps in terms of what it can do. It's a simple app that allows you to add items to a list after which you can press a button that returns one of these items back to you. The moment it returns this item it deletes the list.</p>
<p> It immediately deletes the list because this will force you to go with the option you get, whether you like it or not. Unless you're not lazy because you can just make the list again.</p>
<h2>Console app</h2>
<p>This has more functionalities. Besides making a list and getting a random item back you'll also be able to edit the lists by adding or removing items. Deleting a whole list is possible too.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed this app also won't delete the lists and instead saves them for later so you can use them again.</p>
<h2>Some things I might add later if I feel like it:</h2>
<p>GUI App:</p>
<ol> 
  <li>Save lists</li>
  <li>Edit lists</li>
  <li>Delete lists</li>
</ol>
<p>Console app:</p>
<ol> 
  <li>Random item automatically gets deleted from the list so it won't show up again when you use the list in the future</li>
</ol>
